/**
 * Runs [EnableBankingSyncCoordinator] as WorkManager-managed background work instead of a plain
 * application-scoped coroutine, so a sync that can take a long time (the very first sync, or any
 * sync after local data was wiped — see [EnableBankingSyncCoordinator]'s own doc) survives the
 * app being backgrounded or its process being killed, the same durability the AI categorization
 * backfill already has via [com.financetracker.app.data.ai.AiCategorizationWorker] — including
 * the same batching + [Result.retry] design (not a self-enqueue) to stay inside Android's ~10
 * minute execution ceiling for background work, with the run's total kept in SharedPreferences
 * since a retry replays the original request's input unchanged. The imported count is
 * accumulated across retries the same way: [EnableBankingSyncCoordinator.syncSelectedAccounts]
 * only ever counts what it imported in *that* call, so a multi-retry run's final message would
 * otherwise report only the last batch's count instead of the true total for the whole run —
 * the same bug that made [com.financetracker.app.data.ai.AiCategorizationWorker] report
 * "Categorized 0 of N" despite having genuinely categorized plenty in earlier batches. The
 * skipped/duplicate count is deliberately *not* accumulated the same way: because every
 * invocation re-fetches an account's *entire* history from scratch, a row this run imported in
 * an earlier batch shows up as a "duplicate" again on every later batch's fetch — summing it
 * would inflate "already up to date" further with every retry, so only the last invocation's
 * count (a reasonable snapshot of "how much was already there" for the account as a whole) is
 * reported.
 *
 * A large first sync's fetch phase alone (see [EnableBankingSyncCoordinator]'s doc — Enable
 * Banking paginates an account's entire history, one network round trip per page, all before
 * there's anything to checkpoint) can take longer than Android's ~10 minute execution ceiling
 * for ordinary background work — a real run was observed getting silently killed and restarted
 * from scratch by the system mid-fetch, repeatedly, since that kill happens at the OS level
 * (never going through this worker's own graceful [Result.retry] path, so nothing about the
 * fetch survives it). [doWork] promotes itself to a foreground service (with a visible
 * "Syncing…" notification) for its duration, which lifts that ceiling, the standard WorkManager
 * pattern for work that can legitimately run long.
