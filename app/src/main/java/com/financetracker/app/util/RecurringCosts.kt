 * in Settings > Categories). Nothing outside a Fixe category is ever anticipated: guessing from
 * how often a merchant repeats flagged too many ordinary purchases (restaurants, furniture
 * stores) as bills.
 *
 * Fixe/excluded status and the displayed category come from each series' most recent posting.
 * [EXCLUDED_CATEGORIES] (Parking, Groceries, Fuel) are never anticipated regardless of how often they
 * repeat, or even if marked Fixe — they recur by habit, not by contract, so the same
 * note+category showing up in back-to-back months doesn't mean a bill is coming due.
 *
 * Settings' "Anticipate recurring bills" toggle adds these to the Dashboard's Expenses tile total
 * (see [anticipatedRecurringExpenseTotal]) for whichever month is currently selected — This month
 * or Next month — and lists them individually in that tile's transaction drill-down, so Remaining
 * reflects what's left (or, a month ahead, what's expected) once known fixed costs actually go
 * out, not just what's already posted.
 *
 * Each qualifying, not-yet-posted group projects its most recent occurrence's amount (reacts to
 * a real change — a plan upgrade, a rent increase — faster than averaging would). A group that
 * already has a transaction in the projected month is left alone: it's already counted in the
 * real total there, adding an estimate on top would double-count it. [dismissedKeys] (see
 * [com.financetracker.app.data.prefs.DismissedRecurringExpenses]) excludes anything the user has
 * explicitly removed from that month's list.
 *
 * [scheduled] are the bank's own scheduled-but-not-booked payments (see
 * [com.financetracker.app.data.prefs.BankScheduledPayments]). Every one dated in the projected
 * month is listed at its exact amount and date, whatever its category — the bank knows it's
 * coming, no guessing needed — and takes the place of any Fixe prediction for the same account
 * and merchant, since the bank's date beats an estimate. One that already matches a posted
 * transaction (same account, merchant and amount, within a few days) is skipped.
 *
 * With [excludeTransfers] on, anything whose category is "Other (Transfer)" is left out, the same
 * way the Expenses total leaves posted transfers out.
 *
 * [transactions] and [scheduled] should already be scoped to whichever account (or all accounts)
 * the caller cares about — this only groups and projects, it doesn't filter by account itself.
